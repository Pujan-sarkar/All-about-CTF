# CTF (Capture The Flags)

## What is a CTF?   

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants attempt to solve security-related challenges to find hidden flags (often strings of text) within files, networks, or systems. These flags serve as proof of solving a particular challenge. CTFs are a popular way for individuals to practice and demonstrate their skills in various aspects of cybersecurity.

## Types of CTFs

CTF competitions generally fall into two main categories: Jeopardy-style and Attack-Defense. Additionally, there are specialized types of CTFs focused on specific skill sets or themes.

### 1. Jeopardy-style CTFs

In Jeopardy-style CTFs, participants or teams solve challenges from a board, similar to the game show "Jeopardy!" Challenges are categorized and usually vary in difficulty and point value. Categories can include:

- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing binary code to understand its functionality and find hidden information.[Blogs](https://shuvadeepmondal.blogspot.com/2024/05/introduction-to-reverse-engineering.html)
- **Forensics**: Investigating digital artifacts such as disk images, memory dumps, and network captures to extract hidden data.
- **Cryptography**: Solving puzzles related to encryption and decryption.
- **Web Exploitation**: Finding vulnerabilities in web applications and exploiting them to retrieve flags.
- **Binary Exploitation**: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in compiled binaries.
- **Miscellaneous**: Any other challenges that don't fit into the above categories, often creative or humorous in nature.

### 2. Attack-Defense CTFs

In Attack-Defense CTFs, teams are provided with a vulnerable network or system, and the goal is to defend their own services while attacking the services of other teams. This type of CTF simulates real-world cybersecurity scenarios and typically includes the following elements:

- **Service Defense**: Keeping your own services running and secure against attacks.
- **Service Attack**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in other teams' services to capture flags.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded for both successful defenses and attacks.

### 3. Mixed CTFs

Some CTF competitions combine elements of both Jeopardy-style and Attack-Defense formats. These mixed CTFs might start with a series of Jeopardy-style challenges to gain initial points or resources, followed by an Attack-Defense phase.

### 4. Thematic CTFs

Thematic CTFs focus on specific areas of cybersecurity or incorporate story-driven elements. Examples include:

- **Hardware CTFs**: Challenges related to hardware hacking and embedded systems.
- **Social Engineering CTFs**: Scenarios where participants must use social engineering tactics to obtain information or access.
- **Red vs. Blue CTFs**: Teams are divided into attackers (Red Team) and defenders (Blue Team), with the Blue Team tasked with protecting a network from simulated attacks by the Red Team.

### 5. Educational CTFs

These CTFs are designed for learning and may not be competitive. They often provide hints and learning resources, making them suitable for beginners or for training purposes.
