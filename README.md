## What is a CTF?   

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants attempt to solve security-related challenges to find hidden flags (often strings of text) within files, networks, or systems. These flags serve as proof of solving a particular challenge. CTFs are a popular way for individuals to practice and demonstrate their skills in various aspects of cybersecurity.


## Types of CTFs

CTF competitions generally fall into two main categories: Jeopardy-style and Attack-Defense. Additionally, there are specialized types of CTFs focused on specific skill sets or themes.

### 1. Jeopardy-style CTFs

In Jeopardy-style CTFs, participants or teams solve challenges from a board, similar to the game show "Jeopardy!" Challenges are categorized and usually vary in difficulty and point value. Categories can include:
<pre>
1. Reverse Engineering: Analyzing binary code to understand its functionality and find hidden information.
  
2. Forensics: Investigating digital artifacts such as disk images, memory dumps, and network capture to extract hidden data.
  
3. Cryptography: Solving puzzles related to encryption and decryption.
  
4. Web Exploitation: Finding vulnerabilities in web applications and exploiting them to retrieve flags.
  
5. Binary Exploitation: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in compiled binaries.
  
6. Miscellaneous: Any other challenges that don't fit into the above categories, often creative or humorous in nature.
</pre>
### 2. Attack-Defense CTFs

In Attack-Defense CTFs, teams are provided with a vulnerable network or system, and the goal is to defend their own services while attacking the services of other teams. This type of CTF simulates real-world cybersecurity scenarios and typically includes the following elements:
<pre>
1. Service Defense: Keeping your own services running and secure against attacks.
  
2. Service Attack: Exploiting vulnerabilities in other teams' services to capture flags.
  
3. Scoring: Points are awarded for both successful defenses and attacks.
</pre>
### 3. Mixed CTFs

Some CTF competitions combine elements of both Jeopardy-style and Attack-Defense formats. These mixed CTFs might start with a series of Jeopardy-style challenges to gain initial points or resources, followed by an Attack-Defense phase.

### 4. Thematic CTFs

Thematic CTFs focus on specific areas of cybersecurity or incorporate story-driven elements. Examples include:
<pre>
1. Hardware CTFs: Challenges related to hardware hacking and embedded systems.
  
2. Social Engineering CTFs: Scenarios where participants must use social engineering tactics to obtain information or access.
  
3. Red vs. Blue CTFs: Teams are divided into attackers (Red Team) and defenders (Blue Team), with the Blue Team tasked with 
                      protecting a network from simulated attacks by the Red Team.
</pre>
### 5. Educational CTFs

These CTFs are designed for learning and may not be competitive. They often provide hints and learning resources, making them suitable for beginners or for training purposes.
